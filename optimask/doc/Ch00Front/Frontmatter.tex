\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
Optimask is a revolutionary layout tool for advanced photomask drawing. It is developed after decades of professional experience from elite engineers and researchers in semiconductor and photonics industry companies, as well as scientific institutes and universities. Our team of international developers consist of photonic experts, electronics researchers and computer scientists. Our primary and ultimate goal is to simplify photonics simulation and photomask design as easy as word processing, with increased accuracy, precision, versatility, and portability. We will make photomask drawing a pleasure, and remove the barrier of advanced knowledge, skill-set and training required.

%Create a List of Symbols by using the package {nomencl} (DHH 20041217):
%Add \usepackage{nomencl} and \makeglossary to the preamble,

%BUT NEED TO Run this command line manually: (Thesis2004DHH is the file name you working on)

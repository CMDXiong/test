This directory contains the source for the graphical interface 
of the boolean program.
The graphical interface is platform independent, because it is based on 
wxwindows 1.67.
I hate writing interfaces, even more to document them.
So the only think i will tell is that all those interface menus,dialogs etc.
only produce ascii string that are pased to the commandhandler of boolean.

chandbas.cpp
chandler.cpp

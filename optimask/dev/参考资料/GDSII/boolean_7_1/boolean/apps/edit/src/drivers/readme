This directory contains the source for the drivers used 
by boolean and booleanc.
The drivers for output are based on one base class (drivout.h).
So output to the screen, GDSII files , KEY files etc. all have their own driver class.

For the input seperate parser classes are here to map the file contents
to the internal data structures.

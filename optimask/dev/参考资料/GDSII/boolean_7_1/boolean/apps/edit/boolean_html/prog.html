    </TD></TR></TABLE>
    The GDS-II Postprocessing Tool can be used to modify GDS-II files. It's also
    possible to save files in other formats. There are a few things that you
    should know when working with the program.

    <UL>
    <LI>Frequently used functions can be called using the <A
    href="mousemenu.html">mouse-menu</A>. To let
    the mouse-menu popup, click with the right mouse button in the window.
    <LI>You can zoom in on a drawing. To do so, click the left mouse
    button, in the picture, after releasing it the program will zoom in at this spot.
    The new zoomfactor is visible in the statusbar. Zooming can be done until a zoomfactor of
    approximately 1:100000 is reached. Then the text "Out of range" is placed
    in the statusbar, and the picture is not drawn. Currently the zooming factor is 16.
    <LI>Another way of zooming into a drawing is dragging using your left mouse
    button, in the picture. A rectangle will appear. When the mouse button is
    released, the program will zoom in on this rectangle. The new zoomfactor
    is visible in the statusbar. Zooming can be done until a zoomfactor of
    approximately 1:100000 is reached. Then the text "Out of range" is placed
    in the statusbar, and the picture is not drawn.
    
  <LI>Zoom out again using the mouse-menu are shorcut keys.
  <LI>You can also zoom back one step using the mouse-menu are shortcut keys.
  <LI>To select elements and structures, hold the control-key while clicking
    with the left mouse button in the picture. When on a particular spot in the
    picture there two or more elements are overlapping, the smallest is selected. A group
    of elements / structures can also be selected. Drag using your left mouse
    button and the control-key. All structures and elements completely in the
    rectangle are selected.
    <LI>Deselecting works almost the same. Instead of the control-key, use the
    shift-key.
    <LI>While drawing is in progress, clicking the mouse (any button) will stop the drawing process.
        So a direct zoom in (rectangle or point) can follow.
    <LI>Drawing on the canvas starts with outlines always, at the same time a second canvas is
	maintained in memory. When the complete drawing is finished or the drawing process is 
	interupted with the mouse, this memory canvas is copied to the screen.
      The reason is that if overlapping windows are on top of boolean and later put in the back etc.
	the redrawing is using the memory canvas to redraw the boolean window. This is fast.

  </TR></TABLE>
	
<p>Interactive drawing and editing is organized around toolcontroller, the toolcontroller 
  maintains a stack of initiated tools. Every new tool is added to this stack. 
  This makes it possible to draw e.g. a polygon and in the mean time zoom in to 
  a specific area and draw some more points of the polygon. In the status bar 
  is shown which tool is active at the moment and how many commands are on the 
  stack.There are two kinds of behaviour for the tools, the first is continuous, 
  the other oneshot. For instance pressing 'm' will put the moving tool on the 
  stack, left clicking on a selected items and draging the mouse will move all 
  selected items.The move tool will stay active until <b>'esc' </b>is pressed 
  or <b>endcommand</b> from the popup menu is pressed. If we are in the zoom tool 
  (first level), left clicking in a selected element will intiate the move tool 
  for moving the selected items, and after this remove the move tool from the 
  stack in order to return to zooming mode.</p>
<p>In all tools the shit and control keys will start the select and deselect tools 
  for one shot. As soon as the key is released we return back to the previous 
  tool. </p>
<p>Depending on the active tool, mouse clicks work different. In general editing 
  tools work on selected elements only and will start at a left click in/on a 
  selected element.</p>
<p>The following short cuts are defined for the canvas. </p>
<p>Select/Deselect keys:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>s</b> select tool started (continuous)<br>
    Left Down Click followed by dragging the mouse select all in rectangle<br>
    Left Down followed by Left Up, select element at cursor.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>d</b> deselect tool started (continuous)<br>
    Left Down Click followed by dragging the mouse deselect all in rectangle<br>
    Left Down followed by Left Up, deselect element at cursor.</li>
  <li><b>u</b> unselect all elements (one shot)</li>
  <li><b>shit key</b> select tool becomes active until released (oneshot)</li>
  <li><b>cntrl key</b> deselect tool becomes active until released (oneshot)</li>
</ul>
<p>Function keys:</p>
<UL>
  <LI> F5 to show the mouse pop up menu (not very usefull, just a right mouse 
    click does the same) 
  <LI> F6 zoom back
  <LI> F7 zoom out
  <LI> F8 set relative start 
  <LI> F9 calculate distance
</UL>
<p>Drawing keys (to draw primitives on the current insert layer which is visible 
  in the status bar):</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>p</b> insert a polygon (continuous)<br>
    Left Down Click for every vertex to add, Double click for end of polygon. 
    <br>
    PopUp Menu Undo removes vertexes one by one. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>l</b> insert a polyline (continuous)<br>
    Left Down Click for every vertex to add, Double click for end of polygon. 
    <br>
    PopUp Menu Undo removes vertexes one by one.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>r</b> insert rectangle (continuous) <br>
    Left Down Click followed by dragging the mouse.<br>

  </li>
  <li><b>o</b> insert circle starting at middle (continuous)<br>
    Left Down Click followed by dragging the mouse. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit keys:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>e</b> edit of selected element at a left mouse click (as for as supported 
    for that element) (continuous)</li>
  <li><b>k</b> delete selected element at a left mouse click (continuous)</li>

  <li><b>cursor down</b> scroll down</li>
  <li><b>cursor left</b> scroll left</li>
  <li><b>cursor right</b> scroll right</li>

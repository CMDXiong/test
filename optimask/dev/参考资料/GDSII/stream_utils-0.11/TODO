- Accept file names on command line

- Clean up code a bit

- Warning in ascii2sf if blocksize != 2048

- Sometimes when reading in a corrupt stream file, all of the last
recognized record can't be read. This is understandable, however the
numbers reported aren't always plausible looking.

- Use more efficient I/O

- Does sf2ascii still put tabs in output instead of spaces sometimes?
I can't remember whether I fixed this or not.

- Code is kind of long and linear. It would be a good idea to break it
up a bit and call more functions.

- It would be nice if sf2ascii checked the records to ensure they are
in a legal order

- In ascii2sf, look for occurances of fgets reading into a fixed size
buffer and replace with read_one_line and a pointer from pnews news
software package.

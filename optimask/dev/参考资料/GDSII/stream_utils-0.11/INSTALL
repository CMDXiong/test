These programs were developed under Linux, most recently Slackware 3.4
using a 2.0.30 kernel. The gcc 2.7.2 compiler was used. At one point
they were compiled under HPUX, but this version has not been tried
under HPUX. Any needed changes would be slight.

Before compiling, check out "Makefile", and make any needed changes,
most likely the bin directory.

To compile the programs, type "make".

To clean the directory, type "make clean"

To install the files in the specified bin directory, type "make
install".

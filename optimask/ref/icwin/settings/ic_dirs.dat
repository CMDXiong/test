! This file was created during SETUP.  ICICON needs the information it
! contains to modify the system's PATH and create the ICED_HOME path
! environment variable.  The ICED_HOME path finds its way into a number of
! other environment variables.  If you are tempted to modify this file, make
! a backup first and be prepared for all sorts of "Could not open..." errors
! if you make a mistake.

ICED does not save your cell data bases until the end of an editing session.
This file describes the sequence of steps ICED uses to save your data.  It
is intended to be useful in error recovery if the process fails.

ICED starts by creating a .TMP file for each cell being saved.  These files 
are named cell_name.TMP and will eventually become the .CEL files.  Each .TMP 
file is located in the appropriate directory for the corresponding .CEL file.  
If something goes wrong during this step, ICED will "crash" and you must use 
the journal file to recover your data.  

After all the .TMP files are written, ICED goes through a series of steps for 
each cell it is saving.  ICED completes all these steps for a given cell 
before moving on to the next cell.  If one of these steps fails, ICED issues
a "SAVE ERROR" message, skips the remaining steps for that cell, and goes on 
to the next cell.  (The error messages are displayed on the screen and 
recorded in the .JOU/.LOG file.)  If you get a warning message at this stage:

            DO NOT TRY TO RECOVER USING THE .JOU FILE.  
            DO NOT USE ICED ON ANY OF THE CELLS INVOLVED.

Instead, you should complete the failed/skipped steps by hand.  If you need 
help, call IC Editors' technical support.  So far no data has been lost, BUT 
YOU CAN SCREW IT UP!  

For each cell, ICED goes through the following steps:

Step 1:  If the files cell_name.CEL and cell_name.CL1 both exist, 
         cell_name.CL1 is deleted.

Step 2:  If the file cell_name.CEL exists, it is renamed cell_name.CL1.

Step 3:  The file cell_name.TMP is renamed cell_name.CEL.

Step 4:  In addition, if the cell is being returned to a librarian 
         controlled library, ICED deletes the file cell_name.OUT.  (ICED 
         reads the contents of the file before deleting it.)

After these steps have been completed for all cells ICED renames the session's 
root_name.JOU file root_name.LOG.

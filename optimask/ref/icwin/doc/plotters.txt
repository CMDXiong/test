The following .PDF files are obsolete.  They should work but we no longer 
have printers to test them.

PRINTER: IBM (and compatible) 9-pin printers
24PIN:   Epson (and compatible) 24-pin printers
9PIN:    Same as PRINTER

MKPDF:  The program MKPDF can be used to create or modify .PDF files.  
By far the most common use of MKPDF is to add or change page sizes.  You 
run MKPDF by typing:

                        MKPDF name

at a DOS prompt.  If the file name.PDF exists, MKPDF will read its contents 
and use them as default values when it prompts you for data.  When all 
questions have been answered, MKPDF will overwrite the existing name.PDF.

Because of this behavior, the easiest way to create a .PDF file for a new
plotter (new_name) is to copy an existing .PDF file for a similar plotter to 
new_name.PDF and then type: MKPDF new_name.

One of the prompts asks you for the plotter resolution in dpi (dots per inch).
Neither MKPDF nor MKPLOT checks to see that the value you enter is appropriate 
for your plotter.  Incorrect values can lead to ruined plots.

Near the end of the process, MKPDF prompts you to "Enter special flags: ".
These flags have special meanings for each plotter type.  A summary of the
special flags in use at this time is given below.  To combine flags, add 
their values.  Thus, if you want to set flags 8 and 16 enter the value 24.

Plotter type     Flag                 Meaning
                value

EPSON ESCP2        8    Disable microweave.  (Faster printing, more banding)
                  16    Allow bidirectional printing.  (Faster printing, 
                        vertical lines may be jagged)

HP LARGE FORMAT    1    Disable PJL commands.  MKPDF sends certain HP-PJL 
PLOTTERS (650C,         commands to ensure that Postscript capable plotters
750C, etc.)             are in their HPGL/RTL mode.  Additional HP-PJL
                        commands affect the color mappings on newer HP 
                        plotters.  As far as we know, these HP-PJL commands 
                        do not represent a problem to any RTL compatible 
                        plotters.  However, they can be disabled by setting 
                        special flags=1.
                   2    Mkplot normally forces best quality for 600 dpi and 
                        finer plots and for "dithered" plots.  Setting flags=2 
                        allows you to control the plot quality using the 
                        plotter's front panel.

HP COLOR DESK JET  2    Send plotter specific page size commands to plotter.  
                        (Sets page size to custom=101. Required for HP1120C.)

HP PAINT JET       4    Send plotter specific page size commands to plotter.
                        (Required for PaintJet XL.)

HP COLOR LASER JET 8    Send plotter specific page size commands to plotter.
                        Size code is based on size name.  Coded names are:
                        A(8.5" x 11"), B(11" x 17"), 
                        A5(148mm x 210mm), A4(210mm x 297mm), A3(297mm x 420mm)
                        JB5(182mm x 257mm) and JB4 (250mm x 354mm).  
                        (Required for Laser Jet 5500)  This flag can be used
                        with flag 2 by setting special flags=10.  If you do
                        so sizes with names that don't match those on the list 
                        will be flagged as custom sizes.

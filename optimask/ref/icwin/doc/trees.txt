It can be argued that any program meant to be used on a network should support 
three directory trees.

USER TREE

The user tree would contain files that were modified by a user for his own
use.  It would be stored on the user's computer.

SHARED TREE

The shared tree would contain files that were modified by users and meant to
be shared with other members of a team.  The tree would be stored on a 
centralized server where all team members could access the files.

DISTRIBUTION TREE

The distribution tree would contain the files that came with the program 
distribution.  It could be installed on a server so there is one centralized 
copy of the files or it could be installed on each user's machine for faster 
file access and better reliability on heavily used networks.

Having a separate distribution tree means that program updates can be 
installed without fear of overwriting files that were customized by the user. 
(If the updated program cannot read customized files from the previous 
version, this may have disadvantages.)

When the program searches for a file it would look in the USER TREE, then the
SHARED TREE and finally the DISTRIBUTION TREE.

THE ICED_HOME ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:

The Windows version of ICED now supports up to three directory trees.  The 
root directories for these trees are specified using the ICED_HOME environment
variable.  Recall that a typical icwin.bat (or equivalent .bat file) would
contain a line similar to:

                       SET ICED_HOME=C:\ICWIN;

If you want to use all three trees, you would specify three home directories.
In this case our typical line might become:

                SET ICED_HOME=C:\ICWIN;S:\ICSHARE;C:\ICDIST;

Notice that the order of the directories in ICED_HOME corresponds to the
order in which they a searched for files.

As with the ICED_PATH, ICED_HOME can be split into several lines.  An 
equivalent series of commands is:

                SET ICED_HOME=C:\ICWIN; +
                SET ICED_HOME_1=S:\ICSHARE; +
                SET ICED_HOME_2=C:\ICDIST;

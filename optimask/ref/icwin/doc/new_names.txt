We have finally declared the DOS versions of the DRC, NLE, and LVS obsolete.  
This has allowed us to simplify the file names for the windows versions of 
these programs.  The name changes are as follows:

                      Old Name   => New Name
Released versions:
                    DRC3-NT.EXE  => DRC3.EXE
                    D3RUL-NT.EXE => D3RULES.EXE
                    NLE-NT.EXE   => NLE.EXE
                    NLERU-NT.EXE => RULESNLE.EXE
                    LVS-NT.EXE   => LVS.EXE
                    LPE-NT.EXE   => LPE.EXE
Beta test versions:
                    NLE-NTX.EXE  => NLEX.EXE
                    NLER-NTX.EXE => RULESNLX.EXE
                    DRC3-NTX.EXE => DRC3X.EXE
                    D3RU-NTX.EXE => D3RULESX.EXE

Since users may have the old names built into .CMD, .BAT, and .MEN files, we 
have supplied a series of dummy routines with the old names.  The dummy 
programs just call the renamed programs.

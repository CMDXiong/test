DISPLAY MODES:

Newer video card drivers allow you to change display modes without rebooting.  
ICED cannot handle a change in video modes while it is running.  So if you 
are going to change video modes, exit ICED first, change modes, and then 
restart ICED in the new mode.

VIRTUAL MEMORY:

ICED makes most efficient use of RAM if it relies on Windows to supply virtual
memory support.  Unfortunately, the virtual memory space is limited to 
2048 Meg (2 Gig) in both Windows 95 and Windows NT.  For a variety of reasons, 
ICED limits the size of the data base to 1536 Meg (1.5 Gig) when relying on 
Windows' virtual memory.  Thus, some work-around is required for large data 
bases.

The following option should only be used for very large data bases.  It will
reduce ICED's efficiency.  So if you are using Windows 95 and your data base
is less than 200 Meg or you are using Windows NT and your data base is less
than 1.5 Gig DO NOT USE THESE OPTION!

In icwin.bat on the ICED command line, include the following option:

ICED=size 

The ICED keyword tells ICED to create one or more page swapping files in the
tmp directory.  The size parameter is the maximum size of the data base in
M-Bytes.

FURTHER COMMENTS:

There appears to be a bug in Windows/95/98/Me (but not Windows/NT/2000) 
associated with allocating very large blocks of virtual memory.  It appears 
to be triggered when a single block of memory grows passed 256 Meg.  

I have observed strange behavior in ICED when the Window's NT or Window's 95
virtual memory file is nearly full.  I believe, but am not certain, this is
a windows problem.  In any event, the solution is to make sure that the 
Windows virtual memory files are large enough so that they won't have to be 
extended during an ICED run.
